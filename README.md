# Event Manager
This is a desktop application made in java along with java swing, where you can create, read, update and delete regular events, such as parties, meetings, etc.

This implementation uses mysql as DBMS.

If you want to prove it, first you have to have Netbeans installed with the Java 15, and have installed mysql.
Then you look at the script in /src/com/data/mysql/scheme/Scheme.sql to create the database, then run the application.
